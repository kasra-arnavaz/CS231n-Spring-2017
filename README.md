# CS231n Spring 2017

This is my solution to CS231n Spring 2017 homework assignments. CS231n is a Stanford University course on Convolutional Nerual Networks for Visual Recognition. I found the class super exciting and a unique opportunity to step into the world of computer vision. Check out the course website at http://cs231n.stanford.edu to access lecture videos, project reports, assignments etc.

I myself had not taken the class; I just followed it online and found the homework assignments so instructive that I decided to share them here in case anyone was looking to double-check their answers. Lastly, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to submit an issue.

I'm currently working on assignment 3 and will upload the code as soon as it's finished.
